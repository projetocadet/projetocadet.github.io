Created by two Carioca siblings, Juliana and Davi Leal Louback, Project CADET teaches Rio de Janeiro Municipal School students how to code. Juliana and Davi first started coding in college, while attending federal university in Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO and CEFET), but there are benefits to learning how to code a lot earlier, even in grade school. 

Unfortunately, most public schools in Brazil do not have the infrastructure or resources for a Computer Science curriculum. By partnering with the UNIRIO Center for Exact Sciences and Technology (UNIRIO-CCET), Project CADET was granted access to a computer lab for the 2022 inaugural edition. With the help of their sisters Natali and Larissa, currently STEM students at UNIRIO, Juliana and Davi put together an introduction to coding course with _Microsoft MakeCode for Minecraft_. The _Microsoft MakeCode CS Intro_ curriculum is accessible and fun, developed by a team of experts in education and tecnology. 

The class of 2022 are eleven 4th graders from the Escola Municipal Minas Gerais. The 10-week course is comprised of weekly classes covering the following topics:

* Events
* Coordinates
* Variables 
* Iteration
* Conditioals
* Functions and Parameters
* Arrays
